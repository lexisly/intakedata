Still valid, but not primary",Strongly Agree,Strongly Disagree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,6,"A lot of the surrenders that I see at the shelter are from people just cutting ties with the responsibility of pet ownership. Often we are the first place they come to in order to get rid of their animal. They have not tried other shelters/humane societies or rehoming through social media. They just want to drop the dog off and go, sometimes going as far as to just tie them to the post in front of the building or just dumping them in the parking lot to roam around. There are many surrenders that have serious reasons behind them, I am not saying those don't exist, but it seems that a good sum of our surrenders right now are of people who got dogs while they were ""locked down"" due to covid and are now back at work, moving to a new home, or otherwise have made major life changes and this dog who often was a puppy during 2021 is now a grown adult and is too much for them to handle now that their life has gotten back to ""normal"". Not that anyone will admit to this, but many of these dogs were adopted or purchased during the pandemic. I will not blame the pandemic for the rise in surrenders and I have not seen data to support this statement, my sentiment may be solely based on the emotional impact that these surrenders have on me. That said, I do feel the current housing market, return to work from COVID lockdowns, inflation, and general state of global politics/markets, has a major effect on peoples ability to keep and maintain animals. To extend this, I believe now, more than ever in years past, we live a more consumeristic lifestyle than we ever have. And the idea of responsibility and commitment mean as little as they ever have. Returns are just a way of life, if I don't like something, i just take it back. No harm, no foul. We rush into a decision, if it doesn't work out, we can just undo it with little to no repressions. I will end it there.

In other words the situation or behavior that was most recent to bring them to that decision (which i realize now may not have been consistent with my answers in the scenario questions!). E.g. owner pregnant and dog resource guards. The guarding has not been a problem until the idea of a baby came up, therefore sur reason is ""pregnancy"". However, if dog resource guards and owner is pregnant and dog suddenly bit which hadn't happened before, and is what prompted the surrender, then I would say ""guarding/bite"".",Strongly Agree,Disagree,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Agree,6,"To explain my answer, I think the examples had a lot of ""reasons"" that would contribute to surrenders. And while I do experience that (approximately 60% of the time), I would say there are also some that are very straight-forward (e.g., great dog but fluke incident where he bit 3y old child visiting when they stepped on him, otherwise great with kids and no complaints; great dog but keeps fighting with neighbor's dog, otherwise lives with a dog, good with kids, strangers, no behavior concerns but can't live next door to this particular dog; moving and can't take is a common one and sometimes there are noteworthy behaviors that have been pointed out by the owner but not identified as a problem for them that would contribute to surrender).
In my experience, the majority of dog surrenders have to do with the dog's behavior and I find most people to be upfront about the behaviors.
I also wanted to comment on my breed selection, if an owner identifies a dog as a certain breed (or mixes), we will label it as such unless there is obvious discrepancy. I believe there is a breed bias out there and when we don't know the breed, I find it safe to stick to common, well-known, relatable breeds like ""lab"" and ""shepherd"" and then we just say ""mix"" rather than trying to identify or label secondary breeds.",Scenario#3-DatainputScenario#4-DatainputScenario#2-DatainputScenario#1-Datainput

In my experience more people are upfront about all of the issues they are having, even if it is to justify to themselves that they need to surrender, if someone is not being upfront it is more likely that they do not want to admit to ownership of an animal for fear of judgement from staff or the public. We see a wide variety of surrender reasons, and behavior concerns, like food guarding, are often brought up with further questioning not because someone is hiding the information, but because they didn't think it was as big of a deal, until say they are having a new baby and feel they can no longer manage it, but they may not think it would be a concern for a new home. In my experience, I do not feel pet owners are intentionally untruthful regarding their reasons for surrender. ",Scenario#1-DatainputScenario#4-DatainputScenario#3-DatainputScenario#2-Datainput

We don't try to choose the primary reason that the owner thinks they are surrendering the dog because it is largely irrelevant and can only serve to work against the dog as the owner will say anything that makes them sound reasonable if pressed to do so. Typically, if someone shows up at our door wanting to surrender a dog, they have talked themselves into it long ago, and it would have been better for the dog if they gave it up months before rather than keeping a dog in a place where it was not wanted or appreciated (causing the dog anxiety and further moving it to console itself with excessive barking, digging or chewing).  Although we always offer behavioral advice and help with short-term funding problems, in the end, if an owner still wants to give up their dog, it is because the dog does not fit into their home or lifestyle and they either can't or won't expend the time or resources to change that.  Period.  Therefore, rather than pressing the owner for ""reasons"" (which will only encourage them to exaggerate ""bad"" behavior) we ask about life at home to try to understand the dog and how it did and did not fit into the environment in which it has lived, so we can find a better fit for him or her.

We can do this because we are a small shelter and our intake person is a volunteer that is experienced in interviewing people and knows they will be in charge of placing the dog.  We use the initial comments from the owner to lead us to more information rather than ""reasons"". Thus, ""we don't have enough time for him"" would turn into a conversation about what they spend their time doing, what has changed since they got the dog (new family member, new dog, new interests?).  ""He has too  much energy"" becomes a conversation about what the dog likes to do and how they have tried to exercise the dog (usually you find they have done little). ""I have to move and can't take him"" becomes a conversation about when the move is to take place and whether they might have friends or family members that know the dog and might be able to take him.  ""He is dog aggressive"" reveals that he has actually only gotten into one ""fight"" with the house's other dog that is an 11 year old lab with arthritis that doesn't want to play with a pestering 1 year old pup, and so they got into a tussle in which no dog was injured, but it frightened the owner so much they didn't want to risk another fight.  So, the notes that go onto our preliminary paperwork might look like this... ""home alone in the yard all day""  ""can get over a 3' fence"" ""very energetic, inquisitive, and loves to chew""  ""good with kids 4 and 6 years old""  ""loves the water""  ""not house trained, but always left outside""  ""good with small dogs and cats""  ""home's older Lab doesn't like to play with him, unknown if he gets along with other dogs"".  These are used to understand the dog, test him in new surroundings, and then place him appropriately.",Neutral,Strongly Agree,Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Agree,10,"Scenarios are always related to changes in household circumstances (moving, loss of a job, adding another pet or child, dealing with a long-term illness or injury) combined with the inability or lack of willingness to give the animal priority for time (including exercising and training) or resources (primarily money, but also yard space and house space).
